# Salam 🤝

At the time of writing this README, I'm too tired and uninspired, so here is a TL;DR of my CV:

- Been programming exclusively in Node.js over the past 4 years, so I have a pretty broad and deep knowledge of JS and the Node runtime, its APIs, etc.
- 2x Software Engineering Intern at <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19387589/206187602-2aaad54d-e014-418e-a121-8c483b13bb72.png" height="50" /></p>
  - 🌆 Boston, 2020 – Dramatically improved performance and simplified of several key featurs in a browser-based **graph visualization tool**, that handled graphs with thousands of (possibly nested) nodes. <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b3/Google_Cloud_Network_Topology_-_External_Load_Balancer_Architecture.png" width="500" /></p>
  - 🏙 London, 2021 – Decreased load on a key Fitbit developer tool by `XY%` by designing and developing its local desktop version and a CLI tool.
- Found a [bug](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/42264#issue-782488160) and submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/pull/45810) to <p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19387589/206190417-4361ef1e-df62-4beb-a03a-9a235ff6dd56.png" height="50"/></p>

Currently, I'm trying to escape the hellhole of unfulfilling enterprise apps and find an area of programming where I can be both challenged technically and really improve people's lives for the better. I prefer not to include social media, addictive games, speculation instruments and other cheap entertainment tools in that category.
